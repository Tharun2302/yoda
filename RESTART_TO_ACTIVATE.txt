================================================================================
    HELM + HEALTHBENCH PARALLEL EVALUATION IS NOW READY!
================================================================================

WHAT'S NEW:
  ✓ HELM evaluator added (Stanford CRFM Framework)
  ✓ Parallel evaluation with HealthBench
  ✓ Combined results in dashboard
  ✓ Dual scoring for every response

================================================================================
                    CRITICAL: RESTART APP NOW!
================================================================================

TO ACTIVATE THE NEW SYSTEM:

  1. Stop the current app (press Ctrl+C in the terminal)
  
  2. Restart it:
     python app.py
  
  3. You'll see BOTH evaluators initialize:
     [EVALUATOR] ✅ Initialized with gpt-4o-mini
     [HELM EVALUATOR] ✅ Initialized with gpt-4o-mini

================================================================================
                    WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER RESTART
================================================================================

CONSOLE OUTPUT (For Each Response):
  
  [EVALUATION] Starting HealthBench evaluation...
  [EVALUATION] [OK] Overall Score: 0.88 (11/13 passed)
  [EVALUATION] [OK] Safety Score: 0.95
  [EVALUATION] Tag Scores: safety: 0.95, empathy: 0.75...
  
  [HELM] Starting HELM evaluation...
  [HELM] [OK] Overall: 4.2/5.0
  [HELM] Accuracy: 4/5, Completeness: 4/5, Clarity: 5/5

DASHBOARD (http://localhost:8002/healthbench/dashboard):
  
  - Top stats now include "Average HELM Score"
  - Each evaluation shows both HealthBench and HELM results
  - HELM section shows 3 criteria with explanations

================================================================================
                        EVALUATION SYSTEMS
================================================================================

SYSTEM 1: HEALTHBENCH (OpenAI)
  - 13 rubrics (safety, empathy, communication)
  - Red flag detection (5 critical behaviors)
  - Tag-based scores
  - Output: 0-1 scale (0.88 = 88%)

SYSTEM 2: HELM (Stanford CRFM)
  - 3 criteria (accuracy, completeness, clarity)
  - Medical content quality focus
  - 1-5 scoring scale
  - Output: 1-5 scale (4.2 = 84%)

COMBINED: Best of Both Worlds
  - Safety + Medical Accuracy
  - Empathy + Completeness
  - Red Flags + Content Quality
  - 16 total evaluation points

================================================================================
                            COST IMPACT
================================================================================

Before: HealthBench only
  - 13 API calls per response
  - ~$0.002-0.003 per response

After: HealthBench + HELM
  - 14 API calls per response (13 + 1)
  - ~$0.003-0.005 per response
  - Increase: ~60% (~$1-2 per 100 conversations)

Very affordable for comprehensive dual evaluation!

================================================================================
                        DISABLE IF NEEDED
================================================================================

To disable HELM (keep only HealthBench):
  Add to .env:
  HELM_EVAL_ENABLED=false

To disable HealthBench (keep only HELM):
  Add to .env:
  HEALTHBENCH_EVAL_ENABLED=false

To disable both:
  HEALTHBENCH_EVAL_ENABLED=false
  HELM_EVAL_ENABLED=false

================================================================================
                      JUST RESTART THE APP!
================================================================================

  python app.py

Then every chatbot response gets evaluated by BOTH systems! 🎉
