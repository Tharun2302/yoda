SYNCOPE CLUSTERS
----------------
1. True syncope vs presyncope discrimination
2. Cardiac syncope (arrhythmia, structural, ischemic)
3. Reflex/vasovagal syncope
4. Orthostatic syncope
5. Situational syncope
6. Neurologic mimics (seizure, TIA)
7. Metabolic/toxic causes
8. Syncope in pregnancy
9. Syncope in kids/young adults

Q1. Symptoms on exertion?
A:
- “Dizzy climbing stairs.”

- Syncope with exertion  
- Chest pain with exertion  

=========================================================
SECTION 5 — REFLEX / VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE
=========================================================

CLUES:
- Trigger: standing long, hot environments, fear, pain
- Nausea before fainting
- Sweating
- Vision dimming

Q1. Any warning before fainting?
A:
- “Felt nauseous and sweaty.”

Q2. Setting?
A:
- “Standing in hot room.”

REFLEX PROTECTIVE SIGNS:
- Clear trigger
- Prodrome (nausea, sweating)

=========================================================
SECTION 6 — ORTHOSTATIC SYNCOPE
=========================================================

CAUSES:
- Dehydration
- Blood loss
- Medications (BP meds, diuretics)
- Prolonged bedrest
- Autonomic failure

CLUES:
- Happens when standing
- Improves when lying down
- Lightheadedness on rising

Q1. Position?
A:
- “Got up from bed and fainted.”

Q2. Fluid losses?
A:
- “Been having diarrhea.”

RED FLAGS:

- Syncope + severe vomiting/diarrhea  

=========================================================
SECTION 7 — SITUATIONAL SYNCOPE
=========================================================

TRIGGERS:
- Coughing (tussive)
- Urination (micturition)
- Defecation
- Swallowing
- Pain

Q1. What were you doing?
A:
- “Coughed hard and blacked out.”
- “Fainted after peeing.”

=========================================================
SECTION 8 — NEUROLOGIC MIMICS
=========================================================

SEIZURE CLUES:
- Tongue biting
- Jerking movements
- Post-event confusion
- Loss of bladder control

Q1. Any shaking?
A:
- “People said I shook.”

Q2. Confusion afterward?
A:
- “Took minutes to feel normal.”

TIA CLUES:
- Focal weakness
- Speech difficulty

RED FLAGS:
- Confusion lasting minutes  
- Tongue biting  
- Weakness after event  

=========================================================
SECTION 9 — METABOLIC / TOXIC CAUSES
=========================================================

LOW SUGAR:
- Sweating
- Shaking
- Confusion
- Hunger

ANEMIA:
- Fatigue
- SOB
- Black stools

Q1. Eating pattern?
A:
- “Skipped meals.”

Q2. Bleeding?
A:
- “Black stools.”

RED FLAGS:
- Black stools + fainting  
- Severe vomiting + faintness  

=========================================================
SECTION 10 — SYNCOPE IN PREGNANCY
=========================================================

CAUSES:
- Vasovagal
- Orthostatic
- PE
- Ectopic rupture

=========================================================
SECTION 12 — HIGH-RISK SYNCOPE DECISION LOGIC
=========================================================

ASK:
1. Was there any warning?
2. Occurred during exertion?
3. Associated chest pain?
4. Palpitations?
5. Family history sudden death?
6. Bleeding?
7. Pregnancy?
8. Position at onset?
9. Confusion after event?
10. SOB?

ROUTE:
- During exertion → structural/cardiac  
- No warning → arrhythmic  
- Chest pain → ischemia/dissection/PE  
- Palpitations → arrhythmia  
- Black stools → GI bleed  
- Early pregnancy + pain → ectopic  
- Sudden SOB → PE  

=========================================================
SECTION 13 — GLOBAL SYNCOPE RED FLAGS
=========================================================
- Syncope DURING exercise  
- Syncope WITHOUT prodrome  
- Chest pain before fainting  
- Palpitations before fainting  
- Family history of sudden death  
- SOB or chest pain afterward  
- Black stools or vomiting blood  
- Severe abdominal pain + fainting  
- Confusion post-event
