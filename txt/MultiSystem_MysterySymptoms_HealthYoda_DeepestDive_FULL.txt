=================================================================
FULL VERSION WITH QUESTIONS + REALISTIC PATIENT ANSWERS + RED FLAGS
Developer‑Ready RAG / Intake Knowledge Base File
=================================================================

GOAL:
-----
This module handles patients who present with vague, unexplained, multi‑system,
non‑localizing symptoms — the hardest real‑world scenarios.
It guides the intake agent to systematically uncover patterns pointing to:
- Infection
- Rheumatologic disease
- Malignancy
- Metabolic / endocrine disorders
- Cardiac / pulmonary disease
- Neurologic disease
- Psychiatric / functional symptoms
- Medication or toxin exposure
